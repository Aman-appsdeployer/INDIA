Nuqi’s regulatory obligations in respect of conflicts of interest is set out in Schedule 2. <br/><br/>

              <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">            SCHEDULE 1</p>


            Risk Warnings

            The following is a summary of some of the risks of investing. Please note that this list is not exhaustive and has been provided as an indication of the factors that can affect the value of your investments.<br/>
            You are voluntarily using our services at your own risk. You are aware of the possible risks associated with the use of our platform which may include but are not limited to the risks detailed below.<br/>
            Despite all known and unknown risks, you hereby expressly and voluntarily remise, release, acquit, satisfy and discharge us and agree to hold us harmless of and from all, and all manner of action and actions or omissions, cause and cause of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, bonds, sukuk, bills, damages, judgements, executions, claims and demands, including but not limited to, any and all claims which allege negligent acts and/or omissions committed by us, whether the action arises out of any damage or loss of capital invested while availing of any of the services provided by Nuqi platform or as a result of us executing your approved Plan/instructions:<br/>
             <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">            1.	General:</p>


            All investment is subject to risk and the degree of risk is a matter of judgement and cannot be accurately pre-determined. The value of your investments can go down as well as up and positive returns of both capital and income are not guaranteed. Past performance is not a reliable guide to future performance. Nuqi gives no assurance or guarantees that the value of investments in your Account will not go down or that the investment held in your Account will generate either profits or income, or that any investment or savings goals you may have (even where you notified us of them) will be achieved. Nuqi does not guarantee any returns or positive results.<br/><br/>

                         <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">2.	Equity Risk:</p>


            Investors in equity securities may be exposed to a high level of risk because the prices of equity securities can rise and fall significantly in a short period of time. This could arise due to the fortunes of the companies that issue them or with general stock market or economic conditions.<br/><br/>
                         <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">3.	Fund Risk:</p>


            Funds are securities that closely resemble index funds, but can be bought and sold like common stocks:<br/>

            a)	a fund may fail to accurately track the market segment or index that underlies its investment objective, for example because the portfolio is not rebalanced often enough to keep up with changes in the index (possibly due to costs associated with trading), or because the fund may use sampling methodology rather than replicating the entire portfolio of the index;<br/>
            b)	the value of the fund is exposed to the volatility of the market which the fund tracks. In unfavourable market conditions (e.g. market correction or economic crisis) where the general level of stock, bond, or commodity prices decline, the value of funds will decline accordingly;<br/>
            c)	a fund may not be “actively” managed. Such funds would not necessarily sell a security because the security’s issuer was in financial trouble, unless the security is removed from the applicable index being replicated. Nor will the fund increase exposure to positions that it anticipates increasing in value. As a result, the performance of a fund may be lower than the performance of an actively managed fund;<br/>
            d)	some funds employ leverage, which can magnify the risk of the underlying market segment or index;<br/>
            e)	if the fund does not physically hold the assets but replicates the performance of the index using alternative Shariah compliant investments, there is a risk that the counterparty could default which could result in a loss to the value of the fund;<br/>
            f)	the market price of a fund’s units may trade at a discount to its net asset value;<br/>
            g)	an active trading market for a fund’s units may not develop or be maintained; and<br/>
            h)	there is no assurance that the requirements of the exchange necessary to maintain the listing of a fund will continue to be met or remain unchanged.<br/><br/>
                        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">4.	Credit Risk: </p>


            A fixed income security, like a sukuk, is essentially a promise to pay profit/rent and pay a specified amount at a later time. The probability that the issuer of the fixed income security will fail to honour that promise is called credit risk. Credit rating agencies give investors an idea of how much of a credit risk an issuer represents. If a company or government has a high credit rating, the credit risk tends to be low. A lower credit rating means more credit risk.<br/><br/>

                         <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">5.	Interest/Profit Rate Risk:</p>


            A change in general interest/profit rates is one of the biggest factors affecting fixed-income securities. A sukuk for example, pays profit based on the level of interest/profit rates prevailing when the sukuk is issued. Generally, if interest rates fall, the value of the sukuk rises. This is because the interest/profit rate on the existing sukuk will be higher than the rate on newer sukuks. On the other hand, when general interest/profit rates rise, the price of existing sukuk is expected to drop because they pay less than newer sukuks.<br/><br/>
                        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">6.	Inflation Risk: </p>


            This is the risk of decline in the purchasing power of your savings due to a general rise in prices.<br/><br/>
                         <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">7.	Foreign Currency Risk:</p>


            Investing in securities that are priced in foreign currencies involves foreign currency risk.<br/>

            a)	Securities that are priced in foreign currencies can lose value when the US dollar rises against the foreign currency. As well, foreign governments may impose currency exchange restrictions, which could limit the ability to buy and sell certain foreign investments and could reduce the value of the foreign securities that are held by investors.<br/>
            b)	Intermediary banks may impose fees on transactions in foreign currency including transactions in USD. Any amount paid by Nuqi in this respect will be deducted from your account.<br/><br/>

                        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">8.	Foreign Market Risk: </p>


            Foreign investments involve additional risks because foreign financial markets (e.g. outside of the United States of America or United Kingdom) may be less liquid and companies may be less regulated and have lower standards of accounting and financial reporting. In some countries, an established stock market and legal system that adequately protects the rights of investors may be lacking. Foreign investments can also be affected by social, political, or economic instability. Foreign governments may impose investment restrictions.<br/><br/>

                         <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">9.	Liquidity Risk:</p>


            Liquidity refers to the speed and ease with which an asset can be sold and converted into cash.<br/>

            a)	Most securities can be sold easily and at a fair price. In highly volatile markets, certain securities may become less liquid, which means they cannot be sold as quickly or easily. Some securities may be illiquid because of legal restrictions, the nature of the investment, or certain other features such as guarantees, or a lack of buyers interested in the particular security or market. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or reduced return for a client.<br/>
            b)	Limit orders set by Clients can sometimes remain unfilled or be partially filled despite the asset reaching the target price due to low liquidity of the asset. Nuqi does not control the market and is not liable in the event of lack of demand on the market for that specific asset.<br/><br/>
                          <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">10.	Price Volatility:</p>


            Price volatility is used to describe price fluctuations of an asset.<br/><br/>

            a)	You acknowledge that the price of any asset can and does fluctuate, and that any individual asset may experience downward movements and may under some circumstances even become valueless. You appreciate therefore that there is an inherent risk that, as a result of buying and selling assets, losses may be incurred rather than profit made. This is a risk you are prepared to accept.<br/>
            b)	Unless otherwise indicated or agreed upon any prices shown on our platform are indicative at the time shown based on data that is subject to constant change. The execution price is that which is confirmed to you after your order is executed, although this price may in certain cases differ from the price appearing on the screen at the time the transaction was placed.<br/>
            c)	You acknowledge that any quotations published by us may deviate from the price of the underlying asset/instrument when the transaction goes through. In the event this price difference leads to a negative balance in your Account, then you would need to satisfy any deficiency or debt incurred within three (3) business days.<br/>
            d)	Any order made after the markets are closed will be filled on the next business day once the markets reopen. You acknowledge that the purchase or sell price of the asset as seen before the market close is not guaranteed to be the same once the market reopens. Note that our brokers endeavour to give you the best available bid/offer price on the market.<br/><br/>
                         <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white">11.	System Errors: </p>

You understand that the laws and practices relating to trust accounts in the relevant jurisdiction may differ to those of others, and this may affect your ability to recover the funds deposited in the trust account.<br/>
            2.3.	We have opened the Custody Account. We will, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, use your funds to buy and sell investments on your behalf through the Account, which is a consolidated account we use for all our clients.<br/>

            2.5.	In the event of insolvency of the bank, custodian or other relevant financial institution holding the omnibus client trust account, you understand that you may not be able to fully recover your monies. Further, as your monies are commingled with those of other clients in the same account, you may potentially be exposed to the losses of other clients.<br/>

            2.6.	You agree that:<br/>

            (a)	we may, whether directly or indirectly, hold investments purchased for you in the Custody Account which is an omnibus account, aggregated with other investments of our other clients, and/or the clients of the Custodian, and such investments may not be held in your name. This means that your investments will be commingled with the assets of our other clients and/or the clients of the Custodian. Given such commingling, the investments may be registered collectively in our name, the name of the Custodian, a sub-custodian and/or any other third party and your entitlements may not be identifiable as separate certificates, titles or electronic records. You agree that if there are any dividends, interests, rights, benefits or other proceeds in relation to your investments resulting from such commingling, we shall have full discretion as to the allotment of such dividends, interests, rights, benefits or other proceeds; <br/>
            (b)	In the event of insolvency or default of the Custodian, you understand that you may not be able to fully recover your investments held in the Custody Account. Any shortfall in the investments may be shared among you and our other clients and/or the clients of the Custodian pro rata. As your investments are commingled with those of other clients in the same account, you may potentially be exposed to the losses of other clients;<br/>

            (c)	provided that we have selected or engaged such Custodian in good faith, we shall not be liable to you for any and all loss suffered or incurred by you as a result of any act, omission or insolvency of such Custodian;<br/>
            (d)	where investments are denominated in a foreign currency, the investments may be held in an omnibus custody account with an entity which is licensed, registered or authorised to act as a custodian in the country or territory where such investments are held. In such case, you understand that the laws and practices relating to custody accounts in the relevant jurisdiction may differ. Depending on the jurisdiction, this may affect your ability to recover the investments deposited in the Custody Account;<br/>
            (e)	your investments may be treated as fungible with other investments in the Custody Account and therefore, we are not obliged to deliver any specific investments to you and may instead sell the investments on your behalf at your expense and transfer to your Account the proceeds of such sale (if any).<br/><br/>

We will ask you certain questions about your financial circumstances such as your level of debt and type of income, to help us identify which portfolio is suitable for you to invest in.

           <p className="font-bold text-xl text-white"> 2.	Scope of the Service              </p>


            2.1.	Nuqi will assist in the set-up of an Account for you, and you authorize us to:
            a)	at your request/instruction, provide you with investment advisory and management services (within a range as may be specified by us) and accordance with the terms of the Agreement;
            b)	provide you with a personal recommendation as set out in your Plan. This recommends that monies in your Account are allocated into a portfolio of investments suitable for you. This is based on our consideration of your responses to our questions and any other specific circumstances that you communicate to us;
            c)	transmit buy/sell trade orders on your behalf to our Custodian/Broker for execution, based on your instructions.


            2.2.	You will deposit your monies directly into a trust account as specified by us. This trust account will be held on our behalf by a licensed, registered financial institution, authorised to conduct banking business in the relevant jurisdiction. You understand that the laws and practices relating to trust accounts in the relevant jurisdiction may differ to those of others, and this may affect your ability to recover the funds deposited in the trust account.

            2.3.	We have opened the Custody Account. We will, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, use your funds to buy and sell investments on your behalf through the Account, which is a consolidated account we use for all our clients.

            2.4.	We may hold monies received on your account in an omnibus client trust account together with monies that we hold for other clients. This means that such monies in the trust account will be commingled with the monies of our other clients
            2.5.	In the event of insolvency of the bank, custodian or other relevant financial institution holding the omnibus client trust account, you understand that you may not be able to fully recover your monies. Further, as your monies are commingled with those of other clients in the same account, you may potentially be exposed to the losses of other clients.

            2.6.	You agree that:
            (a)	we may, whether directly or indirectly, hold investments purchased for you in the Custody Account which is an omnibus account, aggregated with other investments of our other clients, and/or the clients of the Custodian, and such investments may not be held in your name. This means that your investments will be commingled with the assets of our other clients and/or the clients of the Custodian. Given such commingling, the investments may be registered collectively in our name, the name of the Custodian, a sub-custodian and/or any other third party and your entitlements may not be identifiable as separate certificates, titles or electronic records. You agree that if there are any dividends, interests, rights, benefits or other proceeds in relation to your investments resulting from such commingling, we shall have full discretion as to the allotment of such dividends, interests, rights, benefits or other proceeds;
            (b)	In the event of insolvency or default of the Custodian, you understand that you may not be able to fully recover your investments held in the Custody Account. Any shortfall in the investments may be shared among you and our other clients and/or the clients of the Custodian pro rata. As your investments are commingled with those of other clients in the same account, you may potentially be exposed to the losses of other clients;
            (c)	provided that we have selected or engaged such Custodian in good faith, we shall not be liable to you for any and all loss suffered or incurred by you as a result of any act, omission or insolvency of such Custodian;
            (d)	where investments are denominated in a foreign currency, the investments may be held in an omnibus custody account with an entity which is licensed, registered or authorised to act as a custodian in the country or territory where such investments are held. In such case, you understand that the laws and practices relating to custody accounts in the relevant jurisdiction may differ. Depending on the jurisdiction, this may affect your ability to recover the investments deposited in the Custody Account;
            (e)	your investments may be treated as fungible with other investments in the Custody Account and therefore, we are not obliged to deliver any specific investments to you and may instead sell the investments on your behalf at your expense and transfer to your Account the proceeds of such sale (if any).
